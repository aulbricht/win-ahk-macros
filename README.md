# Autohotkey macros for Windows

This set of basic hotkeys/macros for Windows include some of my favorite UI enhancements. Some of them are meant to operate the same as similar hotkeys on Mac.
#### Open Cortana (search): alt + space
* Similar to the hotkey for opening Spotlight search on Mac
* Excellent for running applications or doing quick math calculations
#### Window drag: alt + left mouse button + drag
* Typically in Windows, one must click-drag the title bar of a window to reposition it.
* Alt-click anywhere on a given window to reposition it.
* Similar to in Linux
#### Mute volume: pause/break key
* Simple way to mute the volume when you're listening to music and a call comes in, for example
#### Snipping tool: ctrl + alt + 4
* Similar to the hotkey for taking a screenshoton on a Mac
